As annoying as it is, start early in preparing for this.

Tips for next time to help get ready for filing your taxes:
- *Gather all your documents*: Start collecting the documents you’ll need to file your taxes, such as your W-2, 1099, 1098, and other income statements.
- *Know your filing status*: Your filing status can determine which forms you need to fill out, so make sure you know which one applies to you.
- *Check for credits and deductions*: Check to see if you qualify for any credits or deductions that could reduce your tax liability.
- *Deadlines*: Have to file by March 31st of the Calendar year.
- *Choose the right tax preparer*: Went with Kamal this time as he'd done my taxes last year. But feel like can get better deal if I shop around before next time.
