Hiked Mt. Kilimanjaro with Pablo and his son Amal (is 17 now!). It was an incredible experience. Pablo is an experienced mountaineer, having climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro twice before, and Amal was taking on the challenge for the first time.

We set off at 5:10 AM in the morning  and made it to the summit just before sunset at 17:45. The last 2 hours were very steep and strenuous, especially with the strong winds. Pablo said he hadn't experienced such winds during his previous 2 hikes.

But once we reached the summit the views were breathtaking and the feeling of accomplishment at the top was priceless.
