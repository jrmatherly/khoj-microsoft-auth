Went to Serengeti with Pablo, Namita and all our immediate families. So 9 of us!
Saw lions, heynas and cheetahs. Had a swim in the Savannah falls.

The kids enjoyed scaring the Zebras from the Safari jeeps but the driver was not happy about that.

Had dinner at Rakshas Lounge, a chic restaurant in the middle of the Serengeti (wierd juxtaposition).
