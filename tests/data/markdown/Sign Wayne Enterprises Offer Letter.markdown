Awesome start to the new year! Finally got an offer from Wayne Enterprise after 2 months of job hunting.

I hadn't heard of them before for some reason. But I'm going to be doing R&D work to make Bomb proof jackets and Invisibility cloaks, which sounds awesome!

Plus when I asked who their customers were, they said (during the interview) that the work they do is meant for Charity and to help the downtrodden people of the city. They do not sell such products to the military/police. So that allayed my fears of working on stuff that would cause negative impact on society. That's the reason I left Acme Inc. in the first place!

The salary is great, $40K! But I'll have to move to Gotham. I'd have preferred to be near nature but everyone is saying it's better to try Gotham out when you're younger. 🤷🏾
