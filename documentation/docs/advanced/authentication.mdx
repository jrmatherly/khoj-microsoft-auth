# Authenticate (Multi-User Setup)

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

By default, most of the instructions for self-hosting Khoj assume a single user, and so the default configuration is to run in anonymous mode. However, if you want to enable authentication, you can do so using any of the available providers: [Magic Links](#using-magic-links), [Google OAuth](#using-google-oauth), or [Microsoft Entra ID](#using-microsoft-entra-id-azure-ad) as shown below. This can be helpful to make Khoj securely accessible to you and your team.

:::tip[Note]
Remove the `--anonymous-mode` flag from your khoj start up command or docker-compose file to enable authentication.

## Using Magic Links
The most secure way to do this is to integrate with [Resend](https://resend.com).

1. Setup your account at https://resend.com
2. Set an environment variable for `RESEND_API_KEY`. You can get your API key [here](https://resend.com/api-keys).
3. Set an environment variable for `RESEND_EMAIL`. This is the email address that will show up in your `from` field when sending magic links.

This will allow you to automatically send sign-in links to users who want to log in.

It's still possible to use the magic links feature without Resend, but you'll need to manually send the magic links to users who want to log in.

## Manually sending magic links

1. The user will have to enter their email address in the login page at http://localhost:42110/login.

    They'll click `Get Login Link`. Without the Resend API key, this will just create an unverified account for them in the backend

2. You can get their magic link using the admin panel

    Go to the [admin panel](http://localhost:42110/server/admin/database/khojuser/). You'll see a list of users. Search for the user you want to send a magic link to. Tick the checkbox next to their row, and use the action drop down at the top to 'Get email login URL'. This will generate a magic link that you can send to the user, which will appear at the top of the admin interface.

    | Get email login URL | Retrieved login URL |
    |---------------------|---------------------|
    | <img src="/img/admin_get_emali_login.png" alt="Get user magic sign in link" width="400" />| <img src="/img/admin_successful_login_url.png" alt="Successfully retrieved a login URL" width="400" />|

3. Send the magic link to the user. They can click on it to log in.

    Once they click on the link, they'll automatically be logged in. They'll have to repeat this process for every new device they want to log in from, but they shouldn't have to repeat it on the same device.

    A given magic link can only be used once. If the user tries to use it again, they'll be redirected to the login page to get a new magic link.

## Using Google OAuth

For this method, you'll need to use the prod version of the Khoj package. You can install it as below:

<Tabs groupId="server" queryString>
  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">
  Update your `docker-compose.yml` to use the prod image
      ```bash
      image: ghcr.io/khoj-ai/khoj-cloud:latest
      ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="pip" label="Pip">
  ```bash
  pip install khoj[prod]
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

To set up your self-hosted Khoj with Google Auth, you need to create a project in the Google Cloud Console and enable the Google Auth API.

To implement this, you'll need to:
1. [Create authorization credentials](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in) for your application.
2. Open your [Google cloud console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) and create a configuration like below for the relevant `OAuth 2.0 Client IDs` project:
![Google auth login project settings](https://github.com/khoj-ai/khoj/assets/65192171/9bcbf6f4-197d-4d0c-973a-c10b1331c892)

3. Configure these environment variables: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`. You can find these values in the Google cloud console, in the same place where you configured the authorized origins and redirect URIs.

That's it! That should be all you have to do. Now, when you reload Khoj without `--anonymous-mode`, you should be able to use your Google account to sign in.

## Using Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)

Khoj also supports authentication with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory), which is particularly useful for organizations using Microsoft services.

To set up your self-hosted Khoj with Microsoft Entra ID, you need to register an application in the Azure portal:

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and navigate to **Microsoft Entra ID** > **App registrations**.
2. Click on **+ New registration** and provide a name for your application.
3. Under **Supported account types**, select the appropriate option based on your requirements:
   - **Accounts in this organizational directory only** (for a single tenant)
   - **Accounts in any organizational directory** (for multi-tenant deployments)
   - **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts** (for broader access)
4. For the **Redirect URI**, select **Web** and enter the URI in this format: `https://<your-khoj-domain>/auth/redirect/microsoft`
5. Click **Register** to create the application.
6. Once created, note down the **Application (client) ID** from the overview page.
7. Go to **Certificates & secrets** in the left menu, then **Client secrets** tab, and click on **+ New client secret**.
8. Add a description, select an expiration period, and click **Add**.
9. Note down the client secret **Value** (not the Secret ID) immediately, as you won't be able to see it again.

With these values, configure the following environment variables for Khoj:

```bash
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID=<your-application-client-id>
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>
MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID=<your-tenant-id>  # Optional, defaults to "common"
```

The `MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID` is optional and defaults to "common" which works for multi-tenant applications. If your application is restricted to a specific tenant, you should provide your tenant ID here.

When you restart Khoj without `--anonymous-mode`, users will now see the Microsoft sign-in option on the login page if these environment variables are set.
